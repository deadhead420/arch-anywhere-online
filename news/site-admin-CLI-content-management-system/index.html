<p>Author: Dylan Schacht</p>
<p>2016-06-28</p><br>
            <p>I'm creating a web content management system written entirely in bash. I'm calling the project site-admin and it is a way to manage and update content on a website from the CLI. site-admin is currently in the development stage and much is left to do but the goal is to create a simple script which not only allows the user to manage a site, but create one as well.</p><br>
            <p>All files are managed and interacted with by site-admin. The HTML & CSS is pre-written and also still under heavy development. I am currently able to add articles to my site (like the one I'm writing now) with site-admin. I simply write the article and my scipt takes care of adding the content to my site and updating/adding entry to all necessary HTML files. In addition to publishing articles site-admin is also able to add and manage packages in the Arch Anywhere Package Repos.</p><br>
            <p>The arch-anywhere domain and content management tools are still under heavy development but much progress has been made. I plan on releasing site-admin code on github soon as it is currently working flawlessly. This article was published to the site using site-admin and I have created a small package repo under 'Packages'. I will soon share how to access this repo using pacman and release the code to site-admin as well.</p><br>
            <p>The latest release of arch anywhere (2.2.3) will be coming very soon! It will fearure some bug fixes and improvements and possibly OpenRC is I have time to impliment it. Most of my time has been devoted to making improvements and changes to my site and I plan on having it where I want it soon.</p>
            <p> Stay tuned for more - Dylan</p>
